devELOper is an open-source platform designed to assess an engineerâ€™s ability to reason through complex trade-offs in realistic technical scenarios. Traditional coding challenges often fail to capture the real-world skills that define strong engineers, especially as AI-generated code becomes increasingly widespread. This project aims to shift the focus away from rote algorithmic problem-solving and toward evaluating how engineers make decisions, analyze competing solutions, and justify their choices. By presenting users with real-world engineering situations and requiring them to choose and defend a solution, devELOper captures a deeper understanding of engineering thinking. Each submission is evaluated by an AI model based on clarity, insight, and trade-off awareness, and users are given an Elo-style rating that reflects their judgment over time. The goal is to create a more meaningful and scalable way to measure what makes a good engineer.
